        % I'm making this up as I go so please be gentle.
        %
        % No ensemble:
        %   The array of correlation planes
        %   can be [m x n x num_grid_points]
        %   in size, and the vectors are
        %   calculated after that array has
        %   been populated.
        %
        % Temporal ensemble:
        %   The array of correlation planes
        %   can be [ m x n x num_grid_points]
        %   in size, and the vectors are
        %   calculated after all of the images
        %   have contributed to the correlation.
        %
        % Spatial ensemble:
        %   The array of correlation planes
        %   can be [m x n x num_grid_points]
        %   in size, and are all added together
        %   after the array has been populated
        %   and a single vector calculated 
        %   from the result. 
        %   A more efficient way to do this, rather
        %   than saving all of the planes to an array,
        %   would be to add all the planes together
        %   as they are calculated. However, I'm 
        %   choosing to save the planes to a larger
        %   array because doing so is compatible with 
        %   the other two ensemble options 
        %   ("none" and "temporal"). Most systems
        %   The memory requirements won't change from
        %   the other methods, and we don't have
        %   to make any decisions about how to 
        %   store the correlation planes internally.
